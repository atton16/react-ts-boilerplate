# react-ts-boilerplate

### App Features

1. Hello world page
2. Display user's name
3. Set user's name
4. Validate user's name using `formik`
5. In-memory state retention using `RxJS` and `React's Higher-Order Components (HOC)`
6. Declarative routing using `react-router`.
7. Conform with `PWA` standard by using `manifest.json` and `service worker`.

### Emphasis

1. The use of `TypeScript` language and `TSLint` enable us to
   1. write cleaner code,
   2. write more solid code,
   3. avoid using `FlowTypes`
2. Demonstrate the power of `RxJS` to avoid using over-complicating state management framrworks like `Flux` and `Redux`.
   1. This, in turns, also helps us write code that is easier to test
